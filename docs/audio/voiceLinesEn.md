| M1010_S0010_G0360_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Once you're finished making adjustments, you can go ahead and close this out. |

| M1010_S0010_G0320_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | I'm afraid I can't leave this as-is, ma'am. Please give your permission. |

| M1010_S0010_G0140_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Seems your voice recognition is set to mute, which isn't gonna work. I'm gonna call out to you now—make sure you can hear my voice. |
| M1010_S0010_G0120_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Oh, and I should probably let you know that this entire process is being recorded for posterity. |
| M1010_S0010_G0100_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Roger that.                                        |
| M1010_S0010_G0010_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | First, you'll want to check your brightness settings. |
| M1010_S0010_G0150_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Ma'am? Are you there? Can you hear me?             |
| M1010_S0010_G0070_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Let's start by getting the brightness set.         |
| M1010_S0010_G0000_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | 2B, can you hear me? I'm starting your boot sequence. |
| M1010_S0010_G0670_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | But that's what regulations call for. Still, I'll keep it a secret from the Commander. |
| M1010_S0010_G0540_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Okay, check complete.                              |
| M1010_S0010_G0520_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Er, how was that?                                  |
| M1010_S0010_G0560_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Are you serious?                                   |
| M1010_S0010_G0430_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Here, let me try somewhere else. I'm gonna tap you on the arm this time, okay? |
| M1010_S0010_G0080_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Okay. How does this look?                          |
| M1010_S0010_G0420_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Huh? That's odd. Everything should be set up correctly. |
| M1010_S0010_G0330_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Hey, come on now! I'm just trying to follow regulations here. |
| M1010_S0010_G0310_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Yeah, you can't really do that. It needs to be turned on except in very specific cases. |
| M1010_S0010_G0220_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Okay! Settings should all be good to go.           |
| M1010_S0010_G0200_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | All right. Are we good now?                        |
| M1010_S0010_G0390_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | How was that? Did you feel it?                     |
| M1010_S0010_G0190_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Wait, you shouldn't be able to hear me now...      |
| M1010_S0010_G0640_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Hmm... I don't know what's causing this, so we'll need to run some precision diagnostics later. |
| M1010_S0010_G0620_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Okay, great. Thanks.                               |
| M1010_S0010_G0600_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | ...Well?                                           |
| M1010_S0010_G0510_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Should I tap her here, though? She might get angry at me. |
| M1010_S0010_G0290_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | I could set it for you, but you should probably do it yourself. Regulations and all, you know? |
| M1010_S0010_G0180_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Er, could you try and pick up the pace a little bit? This is getting embarrassing... |
| M1010_S0010_G0160_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Uh, hellooo? Go ahead and adjust your settings so you can hear me, all right? |
| M1010_S0010_G0050_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Right then. Let's get started.                     |
| M1010_S0010_G0650_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Regardless, that's the end of the check for now.   |
| M1010_S0010_G0410_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Okay, check complete.                              |
| M1010_S0010_G0570_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | You didn't feel anything just now?                 |
| M1010_S0010_G0500_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Well, if you say so. How about this?               |
| M1010_S0010_G0300_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Huh? Wait, no. You need to leave that turned on.   |
| M1010_S0010_G0580_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Well then, let's try something else.               |
| M1010_S0010_G0490_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | 2B must have felt that... Maybe she's just messing with me. |
| M1010_S0010_G0380_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | I'm gonna tap you on the shoulders, all right?     |
| M1010_S0010_G0270_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Hmm... It seems to be back to normal now. How odd. |
| M1010_S0010_G0700_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Er, this isn't about me, is it? Because I'm really hoping we'll be a good team going forward. |
| M1010_S0010_G0370_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Oh, I see you've turned vibration detection on. Let's run a check to make sure it's working. |
| M1010_S0010_G0280_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Er, hold on. Your self-destruct permissions are missing. Wait a sec, we need to restore those. |
| M1010_S0010_G0260_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Ngh!? What the heck? My pulse rate is rising!      |
| M1010_S0010_G0170_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Adjust the settings until you can hear my voice.   |
| M1010_S0010_G0130_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Now let's take a look at your voice recognition settings. |
| M1010_S0010_G0060_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | We'll go through each adjustment in order.         |
| M1010_S0010_G0040_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Okay, I found the guide! If you can just follow that, it'll make things easier. |
| M1010_S0010_G0020_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | ...Hmm? You don't know how to adjust the brightness? I think it's set up to respond to some kind of input. |
| M1010_S0010_G0690_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | You undid the settings I walked you through...     |
| M1010_S0010_G0240_300_a2b                   | 2B                         | I'm fine, 9S. There's something calming about your voice. |
| M1010_S0010_G0030_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Er, all right. Just give me a second here...       |
| M0010_S0220_G0040_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | What is it?                                        |
| M0010_S0220_G0060_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Do it.                                             |
| M0010_S0220_G0050_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | I was going to send you the map data I collected earlier. |

| M0010_S0770_G0030_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | I'm going after him!                               |
| M0010_S0770_G0000_101_a2b                   | 2B                         | 9S!                                                |

| M5031_S0020_G0030_300_op210                 | Operator 21O               | According to our records, that material can be obtained from the bodies of large bipedal machine lifeforms. |

| M5032_S0010_G0010_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Just how it was manufactured. Pretty boring, actually. |
| M5032_S0010_G0040_300_op210                 | Operator 21O               | Finding one intact might prove tricky, however. The part is easily damaged when the machine housing it is destroyed. |

| M5032_S0010_G0010_300_a9s                   | 9S                         | Let's try the Operator again.                      |
| M5032_S0010_G0020_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | There's still a lot about machines that we don't understand. |

| M5110_S0020_G0040_001_pascal                | Pascal                     | Well, if you would, please consider this a personal request from myself as well. Go find the child as quickly as you can! |
| M5110_S0030_G0350_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Don't know. Don't care.                            |

| M5110_S0020_G0080_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Got it.                                            |
| M5110_S0030_G0330_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Huh. That's actually a hard question, now that I think about it. |
| M5110_S0020_G0010_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Er, Pascal? Is that you?                           |
| M5110_S0010_G0080_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | She sure cares about her little sister, huh?       |
| M5110_S0030_G0160_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | I'm sure she will. But I bet she'll be even happier to see you back home safe and sound. |
| M5110_S0030_G0390_001_roboimouto            |                            | Yeah, but how DO you make 'em?                     |
| M5110_S0030_G0410_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Huh? You're the chatty one. Work it out.           |
| M5110_S0030_G0110_001_roboimouto            |                            | I was looking for my sister's part...              |

| M5110_S0030_G0340_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Kind of deep, really. I mean, where does the wind blow from? What do you think, 2B? |
| M5110_S0030_G0120_001_roboimouto            |                            | But then I got scared and I couldn't move and...and...and... Waaaaah! |
| M5110_S0030_G0150_001_roboimouto            |                            | Y-Yeah. *sniff* She'll be happy, right?            |
| M5110_S0040_G0010_001_roboimouto            |                            | Thanks, mister! Thanks, grumpy lady! Oh, and here. You can have this. |

| M5110_S0030_G0280_001_roboimouto            |                            | What's "soil"?                                     |
| M5110_S0030_G0170_001_roboimouto            |                            | ...'Kay.                                           |

| M5110_S0020_G0030_001_pascal                | Pascal                     | I heard that you were searching for the missing child, yes? |
| M5110_S0030_G0320_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Wind is just a force caused by changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure and... |

| M5120_S0020_G0010_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Man, these chores are a real pain in the butt, huh? |
| M5120_S0020_G0020_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | The Resistance is a valuable ally to YoRHa.        |
| M5120_S0020_G0030_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | By helping them, we also help ourselves.           |
| M5120_S0020_G0040_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | So no. I don't think they're a pain.               |
| M5120_S0020_G0050_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Yeah, yeah...                                      |

| M5121_S0010_G0280_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Look. A corpse.                                    |
| M5121_S0010_G0290_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | You think the box belonged to her?                 |

| M5121_S0010_G0260_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Is this the "music box" she was looking for?       |
| M5121_S0010_G0300_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Poor girl died a long time ago, by the looks of it. |
| M5920_S0060_G0270_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | Yeah, that's true.                                 |
| M5920_S0060_G0260_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Not dying beats dying any day.                     |

| M5920_S0060_G0210_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | I know it's our job and all, but these Resistance types sure do use and abuse us, don't they? |
| M5920_S0060_G0250_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Besides, being a gofer is safer than being locked in combat all the time. |
| M5920_S0060_G0230_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | No complaining about your work.                    |

| M5123_S0010_G0350_001_pod042                | Pod 042                    | Analysis complete: Data set contains information about YoRHa unit A2. |

| M5123_S0030_G0190_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Some things just aren't easy to talk about.        |

| M5123_S0010_G0340_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Pod, analyze and collate the information from those chips. |

| M5123_S0010_G0390_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | That operation was carried out by the YoRHa generation that came before us, right? |
| M5123_S0010_G0140_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | And we can detect the energy released during that process. |

| M5123_S0010_G0220_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | Pod, help me out here.                             |

| M5123_S0010_G0110_001_a2b                   | 2B                         | She wants intel on A2, does she? Where should we start? |
| M5123_S0010_G0230_001_pod042                | Pod 042                    | Analysis: It is believed to be a data log related to YoRHa unit A2. |
| M5123_S0010_G0170_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | ...Yeah, okay. We've got some readings around the abandoned factory. I'll put it on the map. |
| M5123_S0010_G0160_001_a9s                   | 9S                         | So if we detect any stray energy reactions, it probably means A2 is involved. |
